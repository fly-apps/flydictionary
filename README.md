# FlyDictionary

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

A very simple dictionary app with database access for deployment examples which need an app with database access without being too complex.

Inspired by https://github.com/jesperfj/node-postgres-sample - but less Bootstrap, less flexibility and simpler UI/scope.
